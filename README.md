Fixation is a 2 player abstract strategy game of tile placement and bond formation. Players are racing to "Finish" a Formula by placing the last Element possible and earn the most points for the formulas they claimed. Each game is played in 3 rounds, where players take alternating turns placing 1 of their tiles called elements onto an evolving board.

Elements are hexagonal tiles (9 Black, 9 White) that have Potency Markers (Pips) that indicate the maximum number of Elements (tiles) that the Element can bond (Share a Border) with. These range from 1 to 3. The Potency value of another element has no effect on whether or not this element can bond. A 1 can only bond with 1 other tile, whether that is a 1, a 2, or a 3. 

Players draw 3 Elements at random from their bag, and place these face up in front of them as their hand. Black goes first. Black places an Element on the board, and this is now position 0. White then places an Element, and it must bond with at least 1 other Element when it is placed. When there are no available Potency Markers (All possible elements have been bonded) then the player who placed the final Element claims that Formula, and earns the Potency Markers (Pips) as their points. 

As an example: Black plays a 1 pip tile to position 0. (Black plays Mercury as the first Element)
White counters by placing their 1 Pip tile adjecent to black's in position 1. (White forms a Mercurial Bond)
Both tiles are fully bonded, and no other tile can be placed. White claims this formula for a total of one+one=two points.

Alternatively, consider: B.2 to 0
W.2 to 1 (Side D of W.2 bonded with A of B.2)
B.2 to 6, (Side B of B.2 bonds to Side E of W.2 and side C of B.2 bonds with side F of the original B.2)
Since each of the Two potency elements are now bonded with exactly 2 other elements, the Formula is complete and Black, who placed the last Element claims it for six total points.
